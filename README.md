#  Coffee Machine {Python program}
Here's a brief description of the Python code:

The code is for a simple console-based drink vending machine. It has several functions:

1. `print_resources(resources)`: This function prints the current resources (ingredients) available in the machine.

2. `user_choice()`: This function asks the user what drink they would like to have. It keeps asking until the user makes a valid choice or requests a report of the current resources.

3. `total_paid(quaters, dimes, nickles, pennies)`: This function calculates the total amount of money inserted by the user based on the number of each type of coin inserted.

4. `menu_cost(choice)`: This function returns the cost of the chosen drink from a predefined menu.

5. `can_make_drink(drink, menu, resources)`: This function checks if there are enough resources to make the chosen drink. If not, it informs the user which ingredient is missing or not sufficient.

6. `make_drink(drink, menu, resources)`: This function subtracts the ingredients used for making the chosen drink from the resources.

7. `cashing(cost, total_paid)`: This function checks if the user has inserted enough money for their chosen drink. If not, it informs the user and refunds their money. If yes, it calculates and informs the user about their change.

The main loop of the program keeps running until the user decides to stop. In each iteration of the loop, it first asks for the user's choice of drink and checks if there are enough resources to make it. If yes, it then asks for payment and checks if it's enough. If both checks pass, it makes the drink and serves it to the user.

## Tech Stack
The program you see is written in Python, which is a high-level, interpreted programming language. Python is known for its simplicity and readability, which makes it a great choice for beginners as well as experienced developers. It's widely used in various domains like web development, data analysis, machine learning, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, etc.

In the context of this program:
- Python's built-in functions and data structures like `dict` (for storing resources and menu), `float` (for handling money), and `input` (for user interaction) are used.
- Control flow structures like `while` loops and `if` conditions are used to guide the program execution.
- Custom functions are defined and used to modularize the code and improve its readability and maintainability.

No external libraries or frameworks were used in this particular program. It's a simple console-based application that runs in a Python environment. However, Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that can be employed for more complex applications. For example, Flask or Django for web development, NumPy and pandas for data analysis, TensorFlow and PyTorch for machine learning, etc. But those were not needed for this simple console-based application.
## Documentation
Here are the documentations for the technologies you mentioned:

1. **Python's built-in functions and data structures**:
    - `dict`: Python's built-in dictionary is a mutable and indexed collection. It is used to store data in key-value pairs. You can find more about it in the [Python documentation](^1^).
    - `float`: This is a built-in Python function that converts a number or a string to a floating point number. More details can be found [here](^23^).
    - `input`: This function reads a line from input (usually user input), converts it to a string, and returns that string. You can learn more about it [here](^13^).

2. **Control flow structures**:
    - `while loops`: A while loop in Python repeatedly executes a target statement as long as a given condition is true. You can read more about it [here](^18^).
    - `if conditions`: The if statement in Python allows you to test a condition and perform some action based on whether the condition is true or false. More information can be found [here](^18^).

3. **Custom functions**: In Python, you can define your own functions using the `def` keyword. Custom functions help to decompose a large program into small segments which makes the program easy to understand, maintain and debug. If a specific operation is performed in several places in the program, it is good to define a function for that operation to reduce repetitive code. More details on defining your own functions can be found [here](^10^).

Remember, these are just starting points. Python's documentation and various other resources on the web provide much more comprehensive information.

## Lessons Learned
Developing a program like the coffee machine can provide several valuable lessons:

1. **Understanding of Python Basics**: The program uses fundamental Python concepts such as functions, loops, conditionals, and data structures like dictionaries. This helps reinforce your understanding of these concepts.

2. **Problem Solving**: The process of developing the program enhances your problem-solving skills. You learn how to break down a complex problem (like managing a drink machine) into smaller, more manageable parts.

3. **Modular Programming**: The program is divided into several functions each performing a specific task. This is a good practice in programming as it improves the readability and maintainability of the code.

4. **User Interaction**: The program takes input from users and provides appropriate output. This helps you understand how to interact with users in a console environment.

5. **Error Handling**: The program checks for possible errors (like insufficient resources) and handles them gracefully. This is an important aspect of any real-world application.

6. **Real-world Application**: Finally, by creating a simulation of a real-world machine, you learn how programming can be used to solve real-world problems and automate tasks.

Remember, every coding project you undertake enhances your programming skills and problem-solving abilities. Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
